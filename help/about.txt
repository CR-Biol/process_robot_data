OCUTaF is used to process data aquired by TECAN readers/robots. It takes raw data files as
input (placed in a folder, see help for raw data) and performs sorting and simple statistical
processing steps.
 
These steps include:
- Unify raw data from one plate in a single sheet (step 1).
- Substract blanks and calculate relative reporter signals (step 2).
- Rename wells with prespecified sheets and concatenate all sheets if several plates have been
  measured (step 3, optional). For the special requirements of this step, see help on files for
  naming.

After filling all required arguments, hit the 'Run' button to perform all steps.

The 'Reset' button restores all options to their default states. All files from a previous
analysis will REMAIN and not be removed by the 'Reset' button.

To exit the program, hit the 'Cancel' button or choose "Help" > "Exit".

IMPORTANT NOTE: This program is still work-in-progress! Errors may happen. Especially on if
                anything appears on the black console which opened in the background, please
                copy or screenshot the message and let me know!
