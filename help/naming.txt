For automated naming of files, supply a set of correspond Excel generated CSV files (those are
CSV files using the semicolon ';' as delimiter). The number of files have to be equal to the
number of plates in your data set!

The files should be placed in a seperate folder with NO OTHER FILES. 

Naming should be in the same alphabetical order as your barcodes are. Good ways to name the 
files are plate1.csv, plate2.csv, ...


The required layout of each name file is as follows:

	1;		2;		3;		...		12;
A;	name1;		name2;		name3;		...		name12;
B;	name13;		name14;		name15;		...		name24;
C;	name25;		name26;		name27;		...		name36;
...

where nameX is the name you want your well to be named.

You can give the same name to more than one well (e.g. if you have triplicats). 

AVOID the following words in your sample names (capitalization matters!):
    - Unnamed
    - blank
    - medium
    - empty
They will be filtered out from the final sorted file!


EXAMPLE FILES and folder structure can be found in the testsets.
